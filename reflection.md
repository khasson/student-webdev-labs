Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use videos or the solutions for help?
I was more or less able to complete this on my own, I did need to utilize sources for basic syntax
To allow for a bit more of the nuanced solutions and did actually run into issues with some of the
more specific solutions such as the image file.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
I found the form exercise to be useful it seems the most useful or "large" in terms of what we
would be making in the future.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
No, the explanations and work was doable and if nothing else got us on a track that made researching
more advanced or complex problems.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topics better?
Perhaps just having each exercise build off of the other, so that by the end we can see how
bigger scaled projects of files interact with one another.

Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use videos or the solutions for help?
I needed a lot of outside resources which ill post below, although the course material covered the basics
when I was working I found alot of issues just formatting but really thats just trial and error I feel.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
These exercises were really helpful, I do wish it was a bit more nuanced and less about just building exactly
what the images showed since they were great representations given size was unknown ect.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
I struggled a lot with just reversing order and formatting but really thats just syntax and trying things out
so not really.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topics better?
No
