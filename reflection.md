## Reflection Document

### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.
Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use videos or the solutions for help?
I was more or less able to complete this on my own, I did need to utilize sources for basic syntax
To allow for a bit more of the nuanced solutions and did actually run into issues with some of the
more specific solutions such as the image file.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
I found the form exercise to be useful it seems the most useful or "large" in terms of what we
would be making in the future.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
No, the explanations and work was doable and if nothing else got us on a track that made researching
more advanced or complex problems.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topics better?
Perhaps just having each exercise build off of the other, so that by the end we can see how
bigger scaled projects of files interact with one another.

### Flexbook CSS

Enter your reflections on this section here.
Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use videos or the solutions for help?
I needed a lot of outside resources which ill post below, although the course material covered the basics
when I was working I found alot of issues just formatting but really thats just trial and error I feel.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
These exercises were really helpful, I do wish it was a bit more nuanced and less about just building exactly
what the images showed since they were great representations given size was unknown ect.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
I struggled a lot with just reversing order and formatting but really thats just syntax and trying things out
so not really.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topics better?
No

### CSS Grid Areas

Enter your reflections on this section here.
Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use videos or the solutions for help?
I was able to handle these exercises with the notes in lab and a little experience gained beforehand mostly
from when I was learning Flexbook for the above exercises.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
These were solid exercises, they felt easier to handle after the flexbook just due to how I was thinking about
the exercises themselves and layout. I felt exercise 2 basically helped me really visualize and practice using
the grid-area functionality.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
Not really, this lab went fairly smoothly.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topics better?
No

### Javascript

Enter your reflections on this section here.
Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use videos or the solutions for help?
I needed to use some outside references for some of the API questions, mostly just how I formatted my previous
project for my cloud and webservices class. I also referenced the JS geeksforgeeks webpage just for general
syntax.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
I really enjoyed it, I have a little bit of experience with JS but in particular I was a big fan of exercise 3
and 6, 6 for the use of API and 3 for just refreshing my on functionality with objects beforehand.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
No, I struggled a bit with handleing data once it was acquired but thats just syntax the idea makes sense.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topics better?
No

### jQuery

Enter your reflections on this section here.
Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use videos or the solutions for help?
I needed to use alot of outside resources this resource 1: (https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp)
resource 2: (https://dev.to/th3n00bc0d3r/vanilla-js-to-jquery-the-noobs-guide-2ghg) aswell as asking for assistance
from a close friend. I tried to find a few videos but given just understanding the change from vanilla to jquery
would be manipulating the logic/syntax videos werent super helpful.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
The exercises were good I feel like it forced me to look into what makes jQuery better or moreuseful for certain
assignments/programs. It didnt feel too difficult given we had the general idea of what was to be accomplished in
vanilla js already.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
no

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topics better?
Maybe a 3rd exercise in which we didnt have source vanilla js code?
